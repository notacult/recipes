Won tons are something most of us are familiar with in 'chinese'
soup.  However, interesting variations are offered as appetizers
both as ordinary starts to your meal and as an element of dim sum.

I recommend buying the 'skins' or 'wrappers' pre-packaged from
your grocer.  You can also use, 'egg roll' skins in a pinch.
Just divide them in half.

Won Tons can be either fried or steamed once the filling is added.
I have included both processes.

Below is a sample recipe for 'skins'.  I usually buy the ready-made.

************************************************
WON TON SKINS                         2 DOZEN
************************************************

2 c. flour, sifted                1 egg, beaten
1/2 tsp. salt (optional)          2 c. water

Preparation:  Combine water and egg.  Combine flour and salt.
-----------   Add the flour to the egg gradually.  Blend well.

Heat a skillet or griddle.  Brush lightly with oil.  Place a
small amount of batter and spread out till thin by swirlling
in skillet (like a crepe).  Cook for short time.  Do not allow
to brown.  Just till can be removed from cooking surface. If
browned, reduce heat.  Store under damp cloth till filled.
Do not allow to dry out.

There are basically two types of dim sum pastry fillings.  SAVORY
or not-sweet, and SWEET.  Both occur in Won Tons tho' the sweet
type are less common.

***************************************************************
General Assembly and Cooking of Won Tons
***************************************************************

1. Place a 'skin' in the palm of your hand.
2. Using a 'soup' type spoon place a reasonable amount of filling
   on the won ton skin.
3. With finger, moisten edge of won ton skin with warm water.
4. Fold won ton over together from the bottom point to the top.
   This forms a triangle.
5. Press edges firmly together to seal.
6. If 'home-made' use a mix of cornstarch and water; or beaten
   egg and moisten all edges of the won ton to seal.

Your won ton should look something like this:

                       / \
                      /    \
                    /        \
                  /            \
               /__________________\


Assemble all of them before the next step.

DEEP FRYING:

6. Using peanut oil at high heat.  Fry about 4 won tons at a time.
   2 to 3 minutes till crisp.
7. I find that once the oil is hot, a medium heat gives me more
   control over the browning of the won tons.
8. Use a slotted spoon or wire scoop to remove from hot oil.
9. Drain well on paper towels before serving.

STEAMING:

6. Put a good amount of water in your wok.  Bring to a boil.
7. Lightly oil the rack or bamboo steamer basket so won tons
   won't stick while steaming. Can also use a cloth.
8. Place basket or rack in wok above boiling water.
9. Place filled won tons on rack and cover tightly with wok
   lid.
10. Steam 5 to 10 minutes or till done.
11. Remove from wok and serve in steaming basket.

BOILING:

6. Fill deep pot with about 2 quarts of chicken broth or water.
7. Bring to a boil.
8. Fill with won tons.
9. Cook about 10 minutes or till done.
10. Remove with slotted spoon and serve with dipping sauces.
